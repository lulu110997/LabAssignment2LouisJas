# Team Project Title
Automated Back of House Robotic System for Grocery Stores

# 100 Word description of the intended project
Current robotic systems rely on pre-programmed motion patterns to perform repetitive tasks. This is suitable for predicatable events and applications but not for environments that continually undergoes constant change. This project intends to simulate a robotic system that can pick up different items and place it in different locations. This is analogous to how stocks are picked up from pallets and placed on trolleys prior to being placed on the shelves.
The project intends to use a point cloud camera to differentiate between the size of objects and avoid obstacles in the environment. Depending on an object’s size, it will be placed at a specific pre-programmed location. Some object’s will act as a control and the robot will avoid these.

# Robot you intend to use and why
The actual physical UR10 robot is a great choice for simulating an automation process for grocery stores. This is due to it's great reach and a reasonable payload capacity.
